# CM2604 Course Work - Predicting the term deposit subscription using Random Forest and Neural Network Models
Predicting the term deposit subscription

This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on a dataset from a bank's marketing campaign. The project uses two machine learning models: a Random Forest Classifier and a Neural Network, and compares their performance based on various evaluation metrics.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is bank-full.csv, which can be found in the repository.

# How to Run the Code:
Download the Dataset:
Download the bank-full.csv file from the repository and upload it when prompted in the code. The dataset is essential for running the project and will be used to train and evaluate the models.

Uploading the Dataset:
The code will prompt you to upload the dataset at the beginning under the topic "Uploading the dataset". Simply run that code block, click on the upload button and select the bank-full.csv file.

Run the Code:
Once the dataset is uploaded, you can proceed with running the script. The models will be trained and evaluated on the uploaded dataset.
